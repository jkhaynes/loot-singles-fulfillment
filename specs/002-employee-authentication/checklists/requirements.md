# Specification Quality Checklist: Employee Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items pass. The three `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers (FR-008, FR-009, FR-010) — sourced directly from the PRD's own "Remaining Open Questions" section (§41, Q36/Q39/Q38) — were resolved with the Product Owner during `/speckit-specify` and replaced with concrete requirements: 4-digit numeric PIN (FR-008), Manager/Admin-assisted PIN reset only (FR-009), 30-minute inactivity session timeout (FR-010).
